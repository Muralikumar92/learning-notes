## Malwares (First part)

- Virus
  - Auto reproduction by infecting files
  - PE File (EXE, DLL, SYS, SCR, DRV, ...)
  - Non PE: ....HTML?!!
  - Virut?! Sality?!
  - SAMPLE NAME: W32/Virut.A.gen!Eldorado (generic, not disinfectable)

  - DEMO  Sality + Capside

- Worm
  - Network Shares
  - Email
  - Removable media
  - Auto infect via Systems VULNERABILITIES

## Buffer Overflow

- Major security issue that we still facing
- No solution?! Managed code?!
- We are able to migitate damages caused by it (Auditing source code - Auditing binary)
- JAVA/CHROME/ADOBE SandBoxies.
- DEMO  Dis MAMA Buffer Overflow

## Malwares (Second part)

- Trojan
  - Well known TRIOE's story
  - Social engineering!
  - Games, Utilities, Keygen, ...
  - What's inside is limited to the imagination of the developer
  - Mostly created by kits(Subseven, ProRAT)

- Backdoor
  - Method of bypassing normal authentication, securing illegal
  - remote access to a computer
  - Hacker will be able to re-access the system remotely
  - Stealthy

- Keylogger
  - Keyspress logging
  - ++ Screenshots
  - ++ Applications + URL + FORMS
  - Stealthy
  - Software/Hardware
  - Hardware: Keyboard, USB, PS/2, Captured data realtime sent!
  - DEMO:  Free Keylogger

- Spyware

Spyware is software that aids in gathering information about a person or organization without their knowledge and that may send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent, or that asserts control over a computer without the consumer's knowledge. (*source: Wikipedia)

- Rootkit

A rootkit is a stealthy type of software, often malicious, designed to hide the existence of certain processes or programs from normal methods of detection and enable continued privileged access to a computer. (*source: Wikipedia)

DEMO: (Windows) HxD + KD

- Bot
  - C&C
  - Bot
  - DDoS

## Cyber Weapon

- STUXNET
