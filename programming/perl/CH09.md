## Shell to Perl 6

Perl 5 already was a good replacement for any shell programming. With the new features Perl 6 improves this even further. 


### Running shell from Perl 6

- The `shell` function receives a string that is exactly the same as you'd type on the command line and executes the external command on your behalf. 
- It connects the standard output, standard error and standard input to whatever your Perl 6 code had. 
- This can be useful for interactive programs that you want to wrap with your code. 

```perl
use v6;

my $res = shell("ssh perl6maven.com uptime");
say "Command finished";
say $res; 
```

Here we run the ssh command, pass to it the name of the server and the command (uptime) to be executed on the remote server. 

```
$ perl6 run_ssh.p6 
The authenticity of host 'perl6maven.com (173.255.196.65)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is fd:18:2c:05:81:b8:59:54:30.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'perl6maven.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

13:55:57 up 27 days,  2:20,  0 users,  load average: 0.07, 0.09, 0.06
Command finished
Proc::Status.new(exit => 0, pid => Any, signal => 0)
```

- The text 'Command finished' is printed only after the external command has finished.
- The value returned by the shell command is a `Proc::Status object`. 


### Running QX from Perl 6

```perl
use v6;

my $out = QX("ssh perl6maven.com uptime");
say "Command finished";
say $out;
```

The QX function also receives the string that you'd type on the command line, but instead of printing the output to the screen it will return it to the caller and we can assign it to a scalar variable. 

```
Command finished
 14:04:11 up 27 days,  2:28,  0 users,  load average: 0.10, 0.07, 0.05
```

### ls or dir in Perl 6


```perl
use v6;

my @things = dir('.');
for @things -> $t {
	say $t.Str;
	say $t.w;
	say $t.r;
	say $t.f;  # file ?
	if $t.f {
		say $t.s;
	} else {
		say '--';
	}
}
```


### Current Working Directory in Perl 6 (cwd, pwd, $*CWD)


```perl
use v6;

say $*CWD;        # "/home/gabor/work/perl6maven.com".IO
say $*CWD.WHAT;   # (IO::Path)


my $old_path = $*CWD;
my $old_dir = $*CWD.basename;

chdir '..';
say $*CWD;        # "/Users/gabor/work".IO

chdir $old_dir;
say $*CWD;        # "/Users/gabor/work/perl6maven.com".IO

chdir '/';
say $*CWD;        # "/".IO

chdir $old_path;
say $*CWD;        # "/Users/gabor/work/perl6maven.com".IO
```
