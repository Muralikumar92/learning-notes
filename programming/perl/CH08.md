## Perl 6 Regexes

### Regexes in Perl 6

- You can still use `m//` as a regex but as you can see spaces in the regex are non significant. 
- It is quite similar to the effect of `/x` option in PCRE. 

```
In Perl 6 the smart match ~~ operator 
is used for regex matching.

For negative matching use the !~~ operator.
```

**tutorial/regex2/simple.p6**

```perl
use v6;

my $text = "Learning regexes";
if $text ~~ m/ regex / {
    say "This is about regexes!";
}

if $text !~~ m/ foobar / {
    say "No foobar in $text";
}
```

- Regex in Perl 6 disregard spaces by default. 
- People who are used to the Perl 5 style regular expressions - which means basically every programming language that has a regular expression library - will usuall think as spaces being significant in the regular expressions. 


### Match digit

Just as in PCRE some letters have special meaning if the are following a back-slash: `\d` means a digit. 

**tutorial/regex2/simple.p6**

```perl
use v6;

my $phone = "054-1234567";

if $phone ~~ m/ \d / {
    say "There is a digit";
}
```


### Match Any character

The `.` (dot) is a meta-character that will be ready to match any character.

As opposed to the Perl regular expressions in Perl 6 this includes newlines

If you want to match any character except newline you can use the `\N` special character class. 


```perl
use v6;

my $str = 'The black cat climbed to the green tree.';


if ($str ~~ m/c./) {
    say "Matching '$/'";      # 'ck'
}

my $text = "
The black cat
climebed the greeen tree";

if ($text ~~ m/t./) {
    say "Matching '$/'";     # 't '  with the second ' on a new line
}


if ($text ~~ m/t\N/) {
    say "Matching '$/'";     # 'th'    of the word 'the'
}

```

### Escape characters

An important change from the way the reular expressions worked in Perl 5 is that in Perl 6 any non-alphanumeric character needs to be escaped. 



```perl
use v6;

my $phone = "054-1234567";

if $phone ~~ m/ \d \- \d / {
    say "There are two numbers and a hyphen";
}

#or put in quotes:
if $phone ~~ m/ \d '-' \d / {
    say "Still two numbers and a hypen";
}
```

### Spaces in regex

Matching space(s) can be done in several ways 

```perl
use v6;



my $str = 'The black cat climbed to the green tree.';

if $str ~~ m/black  cat/ {
    say "Matching '$/'";
} else {
    say "No match as whitespaces are disregarded";
}
#If there was only one space between 'black' and 'cat' in the regex, then we would get this warning:

#Potential difficulties:
     #Space is not significant here; please use quotes or :s (:sigspace) modifier (or, to suppress this warning, omit the space, or otherwise change the spacing)
     #at files/tutorial/regex2/spaces_in_regex.p6:7
     #------> if $str ~~ m/black‚èè cat/ {

if $str ~~ m/  black \s cat / {
    say "Matching - Perl 5 style white-space meta character works";
}

if $str ~~ m/black  ' '  cat/ {
    say "Matching the real Perl 6 style would be to use strings embedded in regexes";
}


if $str ~~ m/black <space> cat/ {
    say "Matching - or maybe the Perl 6 style is using named character classes ";
}
```

### End of string anchors

of course the above regex will match things that are not phone numbers as well: 

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl6
use v6;

my $phone = "054-1234567";

if "foo 3-4 bar" ~~ m/ \d '-' \d / {
    say "match others as well";
} 
```

- `^` always matches the beginning of the string
- `$` always matches the end of the string
- `+` (and `*`, `?`) are the same quantifiers as earlier

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl6
use v6;

my $phone = "054-1234567";

if $phone ~~ m/ ^ \d+ '-' \d+ $ / {
    say "Use anchors and quantifiers";
} 
```

- to match beginning or end of line, those are `^^` and `$$`
- to match a newline you can use `\n`
- to match any character except newline (the old meaning of .) then just use `\N`. 


### Ranges

ranges in regex are now marked the same way as ranges outside of regexes: 

```perl
use v6;

for '054-1234567', '054-0123456' -> $str {
    if $str ~~ m/ ^ \d+ '-' <[1..9]> \d+ $ / {
        say "$str is a phone number (using range)";
    }
}

```

### Regex Arithmetic

```perl
use v6;

for '054-1234567', '054-0123456' -> $str {
    if $str ~~ m/ ^ \d+ '-' <+digit - [0]> \d+ $ / {
        say "$str is a phone number (using character class arithmetic)";
    }
}

#<[\d] - [0]>  will also work...
```

### Regex Quantifier

You might want to be more specific with the quantifier: 

```perl
use v6;


for '054-1234567', '054-12345678', '054-1234', '08-1234567' -> $str {
    if $str ~~ m/ ^ \d ** 3 '-' <+digit - [0]> \d ** 6 $ / {
        say "$str is a phone number (non-zero + 6 digits)";
    }
}
```

OTOH you might want to be a bit flexible with that number of digits in the prefix: 

```perl
use v6;

for '054-1234567', '054-12345678' , '054-1234', '08-1234567' -> $str {
    if $str ~~ m/ ^ \d ** 2..3 '-' <+digit - [0]> \d ** 6 $ / {
        say "$str is a phone number (2-3 digits, non-zero + 6 digits)";
    }
}
```

### Match several words

```perl
use v6;

my $words = 'foo, bar, moo';

if $words ~~ m/^ [\w+\,\s*]* \w+ $/ {
    say 'match words';
}
```

It could be also written this way: The generic quantifier can also get a separator on its right hand side.

```perl

my $words = 'foo, bar, moo';

if $words ~~ m/^ [\w+] ** [\,\s*] $/ {
    say 'match words again';
}
```

### Alternates

Alternates with first match wins: 

```perl
use v6;

say 'monday' ~~ m/ monday || mon /;
```


### Match object

```perl
use v6;

say 'monday' ~~ m/ monday || mon /;
```

- Every time there is a regex operation a localized version of the match variable `$/` gets set to the actual match. 
- That variable has a lot more power than simply containing the match.

```
$/.from  starting position of the match
$/.to    end position of the match
$/.chars number of characters matched
$/.Str   matched text
$/.orig  original matched string
```

### Capture

but it can be used in other ways as well using parentheses around parts of the regex will capture those parts: 

```perl
use v6;

my $phone = "054-1234567";

if $phone ~~ m/ (\d+) \- (\d+) / {
    say "prefix: $/[0]";   # prefix: 054
    say "number:  $/[1]";  # number:  1234567
    say "full match: $/";  # full match: 054-1234567
}
```

### Named Regex

```perl
use v6;

my $phone = "054-1234567";

#You can also create named regexes:

my regex prefix { \d ** 2..3 }
my regex number { <+digit - [0]> \d ** 6 }
#if $phone ~~ m/^ <prefix> '-' <number> $/ {
#but this does not work now so we write the full syntax:
if $phone ~~ m/^ <prefix=&prefix> '-' <number=&number> $/ {
    say "prefix $/<prefix>  number: $/<number>";
}
#as you can see $/ is also a hash
```

let's create the named regexes for the word and duplicate: 

```perl
use v6;

my $s = 'The elvish brown fox jumped over the the lazy dog';
my regex word { \w+ [ \' \w+]? }
my regex dup  { << <word=&word> \W+ $<word> >> }

if $s ~~ m/ <dup=&dup> / {
    say "Found '{$<dup><word>}' twice in a row";
}
```

### Capture with quantifier

going back to the words but this time replace the square brackets `[]` by parentheses `()` for capturing 

```perl
use v6;

my $words = 'foo, bar, moo';
if $words ~~ m/ (\w+) ** [\,\s*] / {
    say "match words: $/";
    say "$/[0]";
    say "first:  $/[0][0]";
    say "second: $/[0][1]";
    say "third:  $/[0][2]";
    say "all: ", $/[0].join(' | ');
}
```

### Reuse capture

You can also reuse the matches within the regex 

```perl
use v6;

my $s = 'The elvish brown fox jumped over the the lazy dog';
if $s ~~ m/ (\w+) \W+ $0 / {
    say $/[0];
}
#this will print an 'e' which is not what we wanted
```

### Word boundary

```perl
use v6;

my $s = 'The elvish brown fox jumped over the the lazy dog';
#<< and >> mark word boundary
if $s ~~ m/ << (\w+) \W+ $0 >> / {
    say $/[0];  # will print 'the'
}
```

### Rules

```perl
use v6;

#Let's see something else
my $apache = qq{127.0.0.1 - - [10/Apr/2007:10:39:11 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 606 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.3 (Ubuntu-feisty)"};

my regex ip   { \d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+ }
my regex date { \[ .*? \] }

if $apache ~~ m/ <&ip> \s+ \- \s+ \- \s+ <&date> \s+ \"GET / {
    say "Apache: $/";
}


#use the :sigspace modifier or in short :s

if $apache ~~ m/:s <&ip> \- \- <&date> \"GET / {
    say "Apache: $/";
}

my regex apache { :s <&ip> \- \- <&date> \"GET }
if $apache ~~ m/ <&apache> / {
    say "Apache regex: $/";
}

my rule apache_rulez { <&ip> \- \- <&date> \"GET }
if $apache ~~ m/ <&apache_rulez> / {
    say "Apache rule: $/";
}
```

### Tokens

```perl
use v6;

#Let's see something else
my $good = 'this_is_a_long_variable = 456 + 789';
my $bad  = 'this_is_a_long_variable = 456 +';

for $good, $bad -> $exp {
    if $exp ~~ m/:s ^ \w+ \= \d+ \+ \d+ $/ {
        say "Match: $exp";
    }
}

#mark the quantifyers as not backtracking

#m/:s ^ \w+: \= \d+: \+ \d+: $/ {

#or use the :ratchet modifier to set all the 
#quantifiers non-backtracking

#m/:s :ratchet ^ \w+ \= \d+ \+ \d+ $/ {

#and there is a special name for this called token

my token sentence { ^ \w+ \= \d+ \+ \d+ $ }
```

### Replace

```perl
use v6;

#substitution:

my $str = "replace     all    the space   in the string by    one space";

say $str.subst(/ \s+ /, ' ',  :g);
```
